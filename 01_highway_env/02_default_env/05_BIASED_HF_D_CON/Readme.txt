About 01_Policy_Training_BIASED_HF_D_CON

This code is used to train the BIASED_HF_D_CON policy for a Conservative driving behaviour.
The Conservative driving behaviour is obtained by adjusting the bias values in the lines marked with the following comments:(Use Ctrl+F to search)
A. LANE CHANGE FEEDBACK SCORE:
# Bias value 1  : No lane change feedback score
# Bias value 2  : One lane change feedback score
# Bias value 3  : Two lane change feedback score
# Bias value 4  : Three lane change feedback score
B. COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEEDBACK SCORE:
# Bias value 5  : Potential Collision Risk-Avoided Collision by slowing down
# Bias value 6  : Potential Collision Risk-Avoided Collision by speeding up
# Bias value 7  : Potential Collision Risk-Avoided Collision by lane change
# Bias value 8  : Immediate Collision Risk-Emergency Avoidance
# Bias value 9  : Safe Path
C. SPEED OPTIMIZATION FEEDBACK SCORE: 
# Bias value 10 : Low traffic density-Low risk, High Speed optimization
# Bias value 11 : Low traffic density-Low risk, Moderate Speed optimization
# Bias value 12 : Low traffic density-Low risk, Low Speed optimization
# Bias value 13 : Moderate traffic density-Moderate risk, High Speed optimization
# Bias value 14 : Moderate traffic density-Moderate risk, Moderate Speed optimization
# Bias value 15 : Moderate traffic density-Moderate risk, Low Speed optimization
# Bias value 16 : High traffic density-High risk, High Speed optimization
# Bias value 17 : High traffic density-High risk, Moderate Speed optimization
# Bias value 18 : High traffic density-High risk, Low Speed optimization

About 02_Generate_Trajectories_for_Model_Testing_BIASED_HF_D_CON

This code is used to generate the trajectory data frames to be used for model testing of the BIASED_HF_D_CON policy.
The trajectory data frames are generated using the PPO model trained with BIASED_HF_D_CON policy for five distinct seed values.

About 03_Model_Testing_BIASED_HF_D_CON

This code is used to test the trajectories data frames generated by using the PPO model trained with BIASED_HF_D_CON policy. 
It calculates the final misalignment, average terminate time and the average episodic reward for all the data frames.
