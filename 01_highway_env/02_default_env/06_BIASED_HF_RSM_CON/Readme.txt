About 02_Generate_Trajectories_for_Model_Testing_BIASED_HF_RSM_CON

This code is used to generate the trajectory data frames to be used for model testing of the BIASED_HF_RSM_CON policy.
The trajectory data frames are generated using the PPO model trained with BIASED_HF_RSM_CON policy for five distinct seed values.  
* lrs : Learned reward shaping

About 03_Model_Testing_BIASED_HF_RSM_CON

This code is used to test the trajectories data frames generated by using the PPO model trained with BIASED_HF_RSM_CON policy. 
It calculates the misalignment, collision rate and the final reward for each trajectory data frame.
