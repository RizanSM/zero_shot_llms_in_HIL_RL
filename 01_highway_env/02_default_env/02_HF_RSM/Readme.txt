About 02_Generate_Trajectories_for_Model_Testing_HF_RSM 

This code is used to generate the trajectory data frames to be used for model testing of the HF_RSM policy.
The trajectory data frames are generated using the PPO model trained with HF_RSM policy for five distinct seed values.  
* lrs : Learned reward shaping

About 03_Model_Testing_HF_RSM

This code is used to test the trajectories data frames generated by using the PPO model trained with HF_RSM policy. 
It calculates the misalignment, collision rate and the final reward for each trajectory data frame.
